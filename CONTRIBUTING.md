# Contributing to Conductor's Documentation

## Issues

[Open an issue](https://github.com/fjlabs-designs/condutor-documentation/issues/new/choose) when something in the content is incorrect, out-of-date, or if the documentation doesn’t match the actual functionality. 

## Pull Requests

Before proposing significant changes, open an issue so that we can discuss your approach first. Only members of the FJLaboratories organization can open a pull request on the repository, and they should follow the same guidance on opening an issue for significant changes. If you’re not part of the FJLaboratories organization but want to contribute, fork the repository and then create a pull request.

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Commits and commit messages
  - Use smaller commits for your work to make it easier to review. In your commit messages, be specific about what you changed in the files.
- Pull request descriptions
  - Use bullet points to summarize the changes in the commits
  - Add any other information you think is helpful or needs addressed. If your PR fixes an open issue, indicate that your PR is addressing the issue and provide a link to the issue.
