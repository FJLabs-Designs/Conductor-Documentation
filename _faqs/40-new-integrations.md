title: Can you support this software?
categories: [help, faq]

Conductor is designed to be extremely robust and flexible so it is entirely software agnostic! Even if the existing integrations on this site don't have the app you are after, you can still program Conductor to do whatever you want. Conductor supports dual operating modes under the keycode and MIDI modes (see the *Integrations* section above to learn more) and can therefore tap into any existing application that utilizes either one of those control methods.

However, certain control methods are not natively supported by Conductor such as Mackie Control. Third party translation apps are available though to translate between Conductor's MIDI mode and other protocols, but those have not been extensively tested. Consult with the [Community Discord](https://discord.gg/XVSV72Sn) to see if someone has already developed a translation for your protocol, or feel free to post a new question at any time!
